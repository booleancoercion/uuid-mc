A Rust implementation of Minecraft's UUID logic. Includes functions to convert between usernames and online UUIDs (via the mojang API),
and also crucially includes conversion from usernames to offline UUIDs (which was missing from the rust ecosystem).

## Usage
Simply include the latest version of `uuid-mc` in your project. There are examples in the documentation.
